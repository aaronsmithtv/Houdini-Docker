Hbuild is the repository Houdini-Docker generated images. The images are based on `debian:11-slim`. Hbuild provides a complete, lightweight installation of [*Houdini*](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/), a powerful 3D software by SideFX; You can use this image to run Houdini in a containerized environment, making it easy to set up and manage across various platforms and systems, and at a compressed size of ~2.09GB, it is significantly more portable than the average Houdini installation image of ~6.7GB.

## Usage

To run a container with the latest Hbuild Houdini image, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -it --rm aaronsmithtv/hbuild:latest
```

## Quick Start

Once you have started the Docker container using Hbuild, you can quickly get started by running `hserver` (a local service that provides communication with a `sesinetd` license server) alongside `sesictrl` (a utility that interacts with `sesinetd` licenses).

You can optionally allow these services to access to your [*SideFX API credentials*](https://www.sidefx.com/oauth2/applications/).

```shell
hserver --clientid $SIDEFX_CLIENT --clientsecret $SIDEFX_SECRET --host "https://www.sidefx.com/license/sesinetd"
sesictrl login
sesictrl ping
```

If the request is successful, you should eventually see a response indicating the length of time taken to get a response from the license server (Hserver may initially need to restart itself in order to update the credentials).

```shell
2023-03-28 18:15:39 houapi  | Pinging: 'https://www.sidefx.com/license/sesinetd'
2023-03-28 18:15:39 houapi  |   Successfully pinged.

```

Feel free to customize the container by mounting local directories, exposing ports, or setting environment variables as needed.
